@chapter Troubleshooting
When troubleshooting build issues, the following files relative to the @file{build/} directory may be especially useful:

@table @file
@item GNUmakefile
Top-level makefile which contains build settings generated via @b{configure}.

@item log/config.info.txt
Record of output from @b{configure}.

@item log/config.verbose.txt
Record of verbose output from @b{configure}.

@item log/build.txt
Record of output from @command{configure --launch}. Similar output may be recorded using @command{make} depending on which shell is in use, eg: @command{make >& log/build.txt} or @command{make > log/build.txt 2>&1}.

@item log/xcodemake.env.txt
Environment (variables) dump as seen when Xcode forks @command{make}. @value{OS.osx} only.
@end table
