@chapter Prerequisites
The following are the recommended specifications for building on @value{OS.cygwin}; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is possible:

@itemize @bullet
@item Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware (only 32-bit product binaries are supported)
@item @value{OS.cygwin}, gcc 4.2.4
@item yasm 0.7.2.2153 (for i386 or x86_64 architectures)
@end itemize

@include building/prerequisites.bundled.texi

@quotation Note
As of this writing, @value{OS.cygwin} has available to it several versions of gcc; only one of which may be found and used in the path as @code{gcc} and @code{g++}. Configure will thus find what is probably the older version of gcc in a typical @value{OS.cygwin} environment. If you desire to build with the newer gcc, it is found in the path as @command{gcc-4} and @command{g++-4} respectively and you must indicate to configure the desired versions. The following syntax should do the trick:

@example
../configure --gcc=gcc-4
@end example

@chapter Overview
@value{OS.cygwin} builds are performed from a @b{terminal}. There is no support for building from any IDEs.
